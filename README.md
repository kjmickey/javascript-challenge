 UCSD/Trilogy Bootcampspot Javascript homework March 2021

Final files are in UFO-Level-1 folder.  Files at the root level should be identical but were working copies.  

I got it to work by clicking the button, but something is wrong with my code and nothing happens if I hit return instead.

Metro San Diego is well represented!

Was unable to complete UFO-Level-2.  Wrote lots of garbage code that never worked right.
